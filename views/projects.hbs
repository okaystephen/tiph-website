            Project Lumad advocates for the Lumad studentsâ€™ right to claim education by supporting their Bakwit school
            through fundraising money to provide food packages and hygiene kits to the 111 student and teacher residents
            safe inside the University of the Philippines Diliman.
            With the pandemic depleting their already limited resources, threatening the students and teachers with
            hunger
            and disease, Project Lumad asks you to help save the school by sharing aid.
